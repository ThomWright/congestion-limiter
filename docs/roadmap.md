# Roadmap

- [ ] Limit algorithms
  - [ ] Loss-based
    - [x] AIMD
  - [ ] Delay-based
    - [x] Gradient
      - [ ] Time-based short window (e.g. min. 1s, min. 10 samples)
    - [ ] Vegas
  - [ ] Combined loss- and delay-based
- [ ] Tests
  - [ ] Fairness
- [ ] Simulator:
  - [ ] Topology
    - [ ] `Source` and `Sink` interfaces?
    - [ ] `LoadSource -> Option<ClientLimiter> -> Option<ServerLimiter> -> Server`?
    - [ ] `Server -> *Servers`?
  - [ ] LoadSource - cycle through behaviours, e.g. 100 RPS for 10 seconds, 0 RPS for 2 seconds
  - [ ] Results
    - [ ] Each node keep track of own metrics?
    - [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Limiter
  - [ ] Rejection delay
    - Option to add delay before rejecting jobs. Intended to slow down clients, e.g. RabbitMQ retries.
  - [ ] Static partitioning
    - How possible would it be to partition somewhat dynamically? E.g. on customer IDs?
  - [ ] LIFO
    - Optimise for latency
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] README
  - [ ] Rustdoc `#![warn(missing_docs)]`
  - [ ] Move most docs into Rust doc format to view in e.g. crates.io
